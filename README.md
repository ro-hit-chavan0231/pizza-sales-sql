Project Description: Pizza Hut Sales Analysis using SQL
This project focuses on analyzing Pizza Hut's sales data using Structured Query Language (SQL) to uncover key business insights and support strategic decision-making. The main objective is to understand customer preferences, sales trends, and product performance by querying and exploring a structured pizza sales database.

The analysis is divided into three levels: Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced.

At the Basic level, we started by retrieving fundamental metrics such as the total number of orders and total revenue generated from pizza sales. We identified the highest-priced pizza, the most frequently ordered pizza size, and the top 5 most ordered pizza types based on quantity.

In the Intermediate level, we performed table joins to explore relationships between different datasets. We calculated the total quantity of pizzas ordered for each category and analyzed the distribution of orders across different hours of the day. We also examined the average number of pizzas ordered per day and identified the top 3 pizza types that generated the most revenue.

The Advanced level involved more in-depth analysis. We calculated the percentage contribution of each pizza type to the overall revenue to understand their financial impact. A cumulative revenue analysis was performed to observe revenue growth over time. Furthermore, we identified the top 3 revenue-generating pizza types within each pizza category, providing insights into product performance by segment.

Through this project, SQL was used not only as a querying tool but also as a means to generate actionable insights from raw sales data. The findings from this analysis can help Pizza Hut optimize their product offerings, identify sales opportunities, and enhance their marketing strategies. This project also strengthened my skills in data manipulation, aggregation, joins, and time-based analysis using SQL.
